NETFLIX CLONE

This is the NETFLIX clone made by us for the hackathon. This is our first web-development related project, which is why we chose Netflix - A simple website to clone.
The main purpose of the website is to clone the website so it looks very similar to the original one. 
The website is created using HTML and CSS only. 

We learnt the tags in HTML and CSS from youtube videos and tried our best to implement them in cloning the website.
Drawbacks:
We were not able to make the website completely responsive. The part which include images are not responsive. 
Future scope: 
We plan to learn backend development and then add it to the website so that the entire website is cloned.
